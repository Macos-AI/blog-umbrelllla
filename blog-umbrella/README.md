## **SCRUM REVIEW**-&nbsp;Doing Twice the  work  in half the time.
##### _Not just reviewing, but adopting it as a way of life_

CHAPTER ONE

This is a review of "Scrum-Doing twice the work in half the time". Jeff Sutherland is the author of this book. Also, he is the co-creator of scrum.
The purpose of his book is to throw light on the praticality of scrum in other industries apart from tech.

Scrum framework is more concerned with making software development more reliable, faster and effective. Scrum in itself is a framework built on the agile methodologies. The whole concept of agile methodologies lies within the agile manifesto. Scrum was created to put these values in to practice.


 ### Agile Manifesto
> People over processes
> 
>  Product that actually work over documeting what the product is supposed to do
>  
>  Collaborating with customers over negotiating with them.
>  
>  Responding to change over following plan

### Simple, but Powerful
Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you intiate a new project, do well to check on the project regularly, see if you are doing what is heading you towards the right direction and is what people actually want.
Based on this simplistic idea, we will be introduced to a new term. In reality, it is a cycle - The "inspect and adapt cycle".
As we inspect, we will also want to do changes as and when they are noted. This idea is contrary to the tradition waterfall approach, which is more inclined to responding to change only when all features are built. 

### Scrum embraces the following: 
> uncertainty and creativity
> 
> learnig, that enables teams to access what they have created and just as important how they created.
> 
> self-organizing  and rapidly improving both speed and quality of work.

CHAPTER TWO

## <ul>THE ORIGIN OF SCRUM</ul>
Chapter two is all about the origin of scrum. It is such an interesting  chapter to read at the moment. In this chapter, Jeff Sutherland talked about his airforce experience and how it helped him realize some patterns concerning program development. His airforce experience taught to  **OODA**. Yes, he needed to **Observe**,**Orient**,**Decide** and finally **Act**.
He took us on a journey to place he had worked and how he helped organize teams and complete projects within time and at a low cost.
One significant one to consider is with Midcontinent, where he organized a new  team to complete a very unique project. At Midcontinent, he and his team came up with tools that we can now find in Scrum: **Product Owner**, **Product Backlog**, **weekly sprints(Standup meeting)**.
Professor Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka found out that traditional approach to program mamnagement had a lot of fallbacks. Their research on teams that had a diffrerent approach from the traditonal method showed why those teams were successful. 
With the different approach: 
> Teams had automonmy
> 
>They had a transcedent purpsoe 
>
> They are empowered by thier own decision
> 
> Executives were servant-leaders.
> 
> Facilitators had to remove obstacles out of the teams way rather than tell them how and what to do about product development.

Scrum has always been compared to the game of ruby, where the ball gets passed within the team as the team moves in unity down the field.

##### Inspect and Adapt
In every facet of human life there comes a time where we need to adapt to change based on certain results or input from our environment.
We seek to acheive hyperproductivity as teams collaborate and work on a project.
 At the end of this scrum review project, I look forward to receiving answer to this: 
 &nbsp;
- [ ]  How do you build transcendent, autonomous and cross-functional/ fertilization into a team and from  that combination acheive hyperactivity?
- [ ] Why is Scrum structred the way it is?

### Takeaway
> Don't just get better once, get better constantly.
> 
> Don't guess. Plan. Do it. Check and Act. Repeat in regular cycles and you will achieve improvement.
> 
>Always be looking for something to improve 
>
>Scrum requires practice and attention. It needs a continous effort to reach a new state.
>
> **Scrum has its root in Japanese thought and practice.** 

###### **✨We can be better. We can be great. We just have to practice✨**

CHAPTER THREE
#### TEAMS 
Focusing on individuals is a big mistake. Intuitively, we all would want to choose best individuals, but we can consider to choose best performers who get the job done in the shortest time possible and at the same time faster.
Remember to look at teams, not individuals.
"The New Product Development Game"-a book wrttten by Professor Takuechi and Nonaka. In this book, they describe some characteristics of teams in best perfoming companies.
Below are the characteristics: 
> Transcendence

With transcendence, a team has a purpsoe beyond the ordinary. The very real way of having a decison that transforms them from the ordinary into the extraordinary. The decision not to become average, but great, change the way they view themselves and what they are capable of acheiving.

> Autonomous

Teams with autonomy are self-organising and self-managing. They have the freedom to choose how to get the job done - that is having the decision aout how to go about the job. They are empowered to make those decisions stick.

> Cross-functionality

With cross-functional teams, team must have all the necessary skills to get the job done. This skills feed and reinforce one another. As information avialable becomes everyboy's own at that moment. Cross-functionality will create communication saturation which will accelerate the team.
With scrum there must not be any kind of cross-purpose where titles, groups or specialty exit. Each member must have the skills to carry any task.

With scrum, you donot have to yell at people to become self-organing and self-motivated. This must come from within. Just the thought of imposing it on others kill what you want to do.

Transcendce, of course, is a critcal element but it is just one of the elements of a three legged stool.
Just as critical and least celebrated is the freedom to do your work the way you think is the best. Yes, there must be autonomy- one of the main concepts in scrum.
(Getting to decide how you want to do your job to meet the goals set by those leading you)



&nbsp;
CHAPTER FOUR
&nbsp;
### TIME 
Time limits what we can do and what we can acheive as humans. We are bad at giving estimates for how long something is going to take. At the core of scrum is an idea practice known as Sprint.

###### SPRINT
Sprint is a regular time interval where a working piece of a software product is worked on. At the end of the sprint there should be a working piece that can be used by a customer, not an architecture or something in the backend.
The name given to this period of time when you are going to work all out and stop to see where you are was choosen because it evoked a quality of intensity. Sprints are often called time boxes. Each sprint comes with a set fo activities that has to be completed. Those set of activities are listed in a section of  a board called "Backlog". These are task to be taken  on for the duration of the sprint.
The board consists of another section called "Doing". The "Doing" section has to do with all the tasks that are being worked on that week. When the tasks are completed a member fo the team moves the completed task to the "Done" section on the board.
Once the team commits to what is going to be accomplished for that sprint the tasks are locked in.
The memebr whose reposibilty is facilitate the meeting and the processes involved in moving the task from section to section is refered to as the scrum master.

###### DAILY STAND-UP MEETING 
There's suppose to be a daily stand-up meeting each day. The scrum master who facilitaes the process ask three questions: 
>What were you able to acheive yesterday to help the team complete its task for the 
sprint?
>
>What will you be able to acheive today to help the team complete its task for the sprint?
>

>What obstacles are getting into the teams way?

Communication mapping is important in a team. The more everyone knows everything the faster the team moves. The factor that cripples commuincation saturation is specialization. When titles are used, everyone seeks to protect the power of that role and hold on to some specific knowledge. When this happens the team is doomed to fail for sure.

#### Rules for scrum meeting

> The meeting has to occur at regurlar time interval everyday.
> 
> Everyone has to be there and be active.
> 
> Meetings couldn't last more than fifteen minutes.
> 
> The meeting seeks to get the most actionable values and information from the members in the least amount of time.
> 
> The meeting has to be with the same three questions everyday.

CHAPTER FIVE
### WASTE IS A CRIME 
"Waste is a crime against society more than a business loss."-Unkown.
At the heart of scrum is rythm. Humans are creatures of habit, we seek rythm.
We have to get rid of any form of waste. Waste that comes from unreasonableness, inconsistencies and outcomes. We can tackle this by using the PDCA approach described by Deming.
We plan to avoid unreasonableness. We do to avoid waste that come as a result of inconsistencies. We have to check to  avoid waste the emerge form outcomes. Finally, we act, that is having the motivation and will to carry on with the above.

###### DO ONE THNG AT A TIME
Multitasking is painful and at the same time wasteful in itself. When we multitask, our brains has to do a lot of work to deal with context switching and we lose focus. Multitasking deceives us into thinking we are doing more whiles in reality we are doing less work and spending more time switching between task and reorganizing our focus.
With scrum, driving each project to done minimizes the cost of context switching. Doing one thing exclusively before moving on to another saves a little more than half the time. **Concenrate fully on one thing at a time.**


###### HALF DONE ISN'T DONE AT ALL
With each  sprint, the teams tries to get the a number do task to done- completed.
If at the end of a sprint most of the task is half-done, then you're worse off than if you had not started at all. It means time and energy has been expended not to get something valuable. All "work-in progress" or half-built task has to be minimized.

###### DO IT RIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
Whenever a problem or a bug is created or observed, make sure you solve it before moving to any other thing. (The right moment to fix a bug is now and not after the facts)
**Fixing a bug the day it was created takes an hour, but solving it three weeks later would take twenty-four hours to  fix.**
Adopt testing and fixing codes on the same day.

###### WORKING TOO HARD MAKES MORE WORK
Working too long gets less done. Working late is not a sign of commitment, instead it is a sign of failure. People who work long hours start making mistakes, taking  more effort to fix than to create.

Always choose the smoothest way to get things done. If you start thinking of work in terms of discipline and flow, you will start to acheive amazing results.



CHAPTER SIX
### Plan Reality, not Fantasy
Planning is more seductive, so alluring that panning itself becomes more important than the actual plan. And the paln becomes more important than reality.
Do first, what will bring the most value to the project. Prioritize the work.
Refine the plan throught the project rather than upfront.
Plan just enought detail to deliver the next increament of value and estimate the remiander of the project in large chunks.

In Scrum, at the end of each project iteration (Sprint) you should have something of value to demostrate, touch and feel. This should be what a customer can intreract with.

- **Figure out the most important thing and work on those things first.** 
- **Organize a list of task by value**
- **Figure out just how much effort, time and money the project will take.**
With finding out how much effort a task requires, we can use the fibonacci sequence of numbers to calculate the task size which permits us to give an which is should not be 100% accurate. 
This estimate should be done in a group as it will give us a far more accurate estimate than we could come up with.

##### PLANNING POKER
With this method, it is a way of gathering estimates that is fairly quicker and accurate.

###### PLAYING THE GAME
Each person on the team has  a deck of cards with fibonacci numbers written on them.Everyone pulls a card they think represents the right amount of effort and places it face down on the table.
> It not best to have a different group that deals with estimates of tasks. As the people doing the work knows how long and howmuch effort is required to complete the work.

At the same time everyone shows the number on the card and the average of the numbers are taken as the estimate of the task.
When there a three cards in-between card, the person with the lowest card explains why he thinks the task on board requires a little effort to get it completed.
The member with the largest number also, explains why he thinks the work requires that much effort to complete.
Another round of card is displayed to get the estimate.

#####  Have stories, but not task
Humans have a soft spot for stories and narratives. Scrum presents this in its workflow. The first thing to think about is the character or role of the application.

> Who is going to use the application?
> 
>What we want done in the first place? 
>
>This is excatly where we start and stop?
>
> **We will also want to think of motivation.**
> 
> Why does this character wants this particular feature in the application?
> 
> How is it going to serve and delight this customer?

Define the character, role or person going to use what you are building.Know their dislikes, likes, passion, enthusiasm, fustration and joy. Understand  thier motivation.

#### Writing stories
"As a customer, I want to view and make changes to my user profile"

"As an admin, I want to a prove and deactivate users"

These stories should be actionable enough, without the writter describing 
the story. 

###### Know your velocity
At the end of the sprint, the team needs to count the task that were completed, total the points that they were estimated at and that point will tell you how that team is going interms of its velocity.

Once you know the velocity, then you can answer what thinngs are keeping the team from accelarating?

***Note: Moving those impediments is the key to accelerating the velocity of the team.**
