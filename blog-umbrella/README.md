## **SCRUM REVIEW**-&nbsp;Doing Twice the  work  in half the time.
##### _Not just reviewing, but adopting it as a way of life_

CHAPTER ONE

This is a review of "Scrum-Doing twice the work in half the time". Jeff Sutherland is the author of this book. Also, he is the co-creator of scrum.
The purpose of his book is to throw light on the praticality of scrum in other industries apart from tech.

Scrum framework is more concerned with making software development more reliable, faster and effective. Scrum in itself is a framework built on the agile methodologies. The whole concept of agile methodologies lies within the agile manifesto. Scrum was created to put these values in to practice.


 ### Agile Manifesto
> People over processes
> 
>  Product that actually work over documeting what the product is supposed to do
>  
>  Collaborating with customers over negotiating with them.
>  
>  Responding to change over following plan

### Simple, but Powerful
Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you intiate a new project, do well to check on the project regularly, see if you are doing what is heading you towards the right direction and is what people actually want.
Based on this simplistic idea, we will be introduced to a new term. In reality, it is a cycle - The "inspect and adapt cycle".
As we inspect, we will also want to do changes as and when they are noted. This idea is contrary to the tradition waterfall approach, which is more inclined to responding to change only when all features are built. 

### Scrum embraces the following: 
> uncertainty and creativity
> 
> learnig, that enables teams to access what they have created and just as important how they created.
> 
> self-organizing  and rapidly improving both speed and quality of work.



CHAPTER TWO

## <ul>THE ORIGIN OF SCRUM</ul>
Chapter two is all about the origin of scrum. It is such an interesting  chapter to read at the moment. In this chapter, Jeff Sutherland talked about his airforce experience and how it helped him realize some patterns concerning program development. His airforce experience taught to  **OODA**. Yes, he needed to **Observe**,**Orient**,**Decide** and finally **Act**.
He took us on a journey to place he had worked and how he helped organize teams and complete projects within time and at a low cost.
One significant one to consider is with Midcontinent, where he organized a new  team to complete a very unique project. At Midcontinent, he and his team came up with tools that we can now find in Scrum: **Product Owner**, **Product Backlog**, **weekly sprints(Standup meeting)**.
Professor Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka found out that traditional approach to program mamnagement had a lot of fallbacks. Their research on teams that had a diffrerent approach from the traditonal method showed why those teams were successful. 
With the different approach: 
> Teams had automonmy
> 
>They had a transcedent purpsoe 
>
> They are empowered by thier own decision
> 
> Executives were servant-leaders.
> 
> Facilitators had to remove obstacles out of the teams way rather than tell them how and what to do about product development.

Scrum has always been compared to the game of ruby, where the ball gets passed within the team as the team moves in unity down the field.

##### Inspect and Adapt
In every facet of human life there comes a time where we need to adapt to change based on certain results or input from our environment.
We seek to acheive hyperproductivity as teams collaborate and work on a project.
 At the end of this scrum review project, I look forward to receiving answer to this: 
 &nbsp;
- [ ]  How do you build transcendent, autonomous and cross-functional/ fertilization into a team and from  that combination acheive hyperactivity?
- [ ] Why is Scrum structred the way it is?

### Takeaway
> Don't just get better once, get better constantly.
> 
> Don't guess. Plan. Do it. Check and Act. Repeat in regular cycles and you will achieve improvement.
> 
>Always be looking for something to improve 
>
>Scrum requires practice and attention. It needs a continous effort to reach a new state.
>
> **Scrum has its root in Japanese thought and practice.**
